# üëã Welcome to DevMon

**DevMon** (short for *DevOps Monitor*) is an open-source platform designed to give DevOps, SRE, and Platform teams a real-time, unified view of the operational status of all critical developer tools ‚Äî such as GitHub, Jenkins, DockerHub, Azure DevOps, and more.

No more checking multiple status pages manually. DevMon centralizes, normalizes, and alerts you when your tools have incidents ‚Äî so you can focus on building.

## üß± Microservices Architecture

DevMon is built using Spring Boot, Docker, MongoDB, and MySQL, and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and OOP principles. Services are decoupled and scalable using a Microservice Design Architecture.

| Microservice           | Role |
|------------------------|------|
| `status-collector`     | Polls external tools and normalizes data |
| `notification-service` | Sends alerts to subscribed channels |
| `incident-log`         | Stores and exposes historical incident data |
| `admin-config`         | Administers tool configs and schedules |
| `dashboard-api`        | API gateway for the frontend interface |
